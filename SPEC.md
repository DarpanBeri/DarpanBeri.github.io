# Technical Specification

## Project Organization
- Active development in root directory
- Reference materials in old_website/ (excluded from version control)
- Version control via Git with GitHub Pages deployment
- .gitignore configured for reference files and system artifacts

## Current Architecture
- Base template: rabbit-master
- Custom modifications from old_website
- Bootstrap-based responsive design
- Font Awesome for icons
- jQuery for interactions

## Component Analysis

### Header/Navigation
- Simple vertical navigation
- Social media links (LinkedIn, GitHub, Email)
- Avatar image with name
- Personal tagline

### Sections
1. Home
   - Full-height landing page
   - Avatar centered
   - Social links
   - Navigation buttons

2. About
   - Split layout (image + content)
   - Education info
   - Skills list
   - Personal description

3. Work
   - Carousel/slider (currently not functional)
   - Project showcase
   - Academic achievements
   - Current and previous projects

4. Contact
   - Contact form (non-functional)
   - Location information (needs update)
   - Basic form fields (name, email, message)

## Technical Debt
1. JavaScript Dependencies
   - jQuery 3.1.0 (outdated)
   - Bootstrap (old version)
   - Custom script.js with potential unused code

2. CSS Structure
   - Multiple CSS files with potential redundancy
   - Vendor prefixes using outdated -vendor- syntax
   - Missing responsive design for some components

3. Asset Management
   - Unoptimized images
   - Duplicate font awesome files
   - Missing favicon
   - Redundant assets from template

## Performance Considerations
- Large image files need optimization
- Multiple CSS/JS files could be concatenated
- Font loading could be optimized
- No caching strategy implemented

## Browser Compatibility
- Needs testing on:
  - Chrome
  - Firefox
  - Safari
  - Edge
  - Mobile browsers

## Security
- Form submission needs proper validation
- No CSRF protection
- Links need rel="noopener" for external URLs
- Missing security headers

## Accessibility
- Need ARIA labels
- Color contrast verification needed
- Keyboard navigation improvements needed
- Screen reader compatibility check needed

## Version Control Strategy
- Main branch for production (GitHub Pages)
- Reference code excluded via .gitignore
- Systematic commit process for tracked changes
- Documentation updates synchronized with code changes
