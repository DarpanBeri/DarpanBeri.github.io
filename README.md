## Analytics
The website uses Google Analytics 4 to track:
- Document downloads and interactions
- Form submissions and success rates
- Page navigation patterns
- Theme preference usage
- Carousel interactions
- Easter egg discoveries

## Production Notes
- Contact form uses Formspree.
- Form includes validation and error handling
- All external links use noopener for security
- Cross-browser tested and optimized
- Accessibility features implemented
- All CDN resources protected with Subresource Integrity (SRI) checks

## Contact Form

The contact form is integrated with [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) for handling submissions. It uses AJAX to submit the form without reloading the page. The following features are implemented:

- **AJAX Submission**: The form submits asynchronously using the Fetch API.
- **Validation**: Input fields are validated for required values and proper email format.
- **Loading State**: A loading indicator is displayed on the submit button during submission.
- **Feedback**: Success or error messages are displayed to the user after submission.
- **Minimalist Design**: Clean, modern interface with placeholder text and subtle styling.

### How to Use

1. Navigate to the "Contact" section of the website.
2. Fill in the required fields (Name, Email, and Message).
3. Click the "Send Message" button.
4. A success message will appear if the submission is successful. Otherwise, an error message will be displayed.

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure the Formspree endpoint (`action` attribute in the form) is correctly configured.
- Check the browser console for any errors if the form does not work as expected.

## Future Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement responsive image loading with lazy loading
- Minify CSS, JS and HTML files for faster load times
- Enhance PWA features for offline capabilities

### Content & UX Enhancements
- Improve text information to make content more accessible to non-technical visitors
- Enhance grammar and sentence structure throughout the website
- Add project filtering capabilities for easier navigation

### Technical Improvements
- Conduct Code Security Audit
- Implement additional accessibility enhancements
- Optimize animations and transitions for smoother performance
